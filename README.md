### A simple dashboard for following your favorite stocks.

Live demo | [Stocks Watchlist](https://stocks-watchlist-ritwaldev.vercel.app/)

# How to use

You will need to sign up for a Yahoo Finance API account to get your API keys, then clone this repo and create a .env.local file and add the following key:

API_KEY= "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"

# Note

Yahoo API free account limit is 100 requests per day. If you don't get charts data in the demo site, its probably because this limit has been exceeded.
